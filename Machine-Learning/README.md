Dynamic Pricing (Uber vs Lyft):
Dataset consisting of 6,93,071 data points with 57 features. Comparing taxi services 
based on pricing, source, weather, etc. Data cleaning was done to make the dataset usable by handling 
missing values, fixing data types, followed by EDA using Seaborn and Plotly libraries to analyse
parameters like seasonal variation, surge pricing, and weather impacts. Employed statistical tests like 
Q-Q plots, the Chi-Square test, and Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation for feature selection and applied 
various models, achieving optimal results with SGD Regressor, Lasso Regressor, Elastic Net Regressor, 
Logistic Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict ride costs.
